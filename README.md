andreas kefalas, a data scientist and problem solver based in queens, ny. originally from athens, greece, my journey has taken me from the basketball courts of um st. louis to building ml models and data pipelines at canon usa.

## what i do
i build attribution models, lead scoring systems, and data pipelines that actually move the needle. whether it's snowflake, python, or wrangling messy marketing data into something useful, i like making things work. lately i've been integrating llms and generative ai into analytics workflows to speed things up.
## my tools

data science: python, scikit-learn, xgboost, sql, r (throwback), pandas
data engineering: snowflake, aws, fivetran, airflow, kafka, spark
bi tools: tableau, powerbi, apache superset
currently exploring: llms, nlp, generative ai for analytics

## what i like
you'll find me wrenching under a bmw hood or breaking door panels trying to change window regulators.
